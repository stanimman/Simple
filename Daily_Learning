Loss Function :

Softmax Function is a activation function given by the following formula 

softmax function =  (e^wxk) / sigma j = 1 to k (e^wxj)

Now this function allows us to interpret the output as probabilities since it is normalized. Now the Cost entropy error  is the measure of 
error  calculated at this softmax layer given by 

    softmax function              −log(efyi∑jefj)

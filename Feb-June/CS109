Statistical Model

Parametric model Exploration :

Exponential Distribution - Rate distribution (Lambda) - The rate at which email arrives 
Density is not the probability , it can be greater than one . You integrate the density function to get the probability value ., 
eg ; for any x what is the probability that it will be btw 4 to 9 can be obtained by integrating the density function. Need to write the eqn.

The most important property of this distribution is it is memoryless which means


Weibull Distribution  - Most used in survival analysis
Take en exponential distribution and raise it to a power you get the Weibull distribution. 

Family Tree of Parametric Distributions

Binomial Distribution

Poisson Distribution - most used for counts / Shd be working with rare event (mutation of genes etc.,)

Zero Inflated Poisson

Negative Binomial

Normal Distribution :
68-95-99.7% rule
Maximizes the entropy
Central Limit Theorem : A large number (n>30) of random Independent variable will make a normal distribution

Log Normal Distribution (Human heights / Finance (stock market) - Widely used

Theorem if your data is positive and doesn't work take log of the data 


Binomial distribution approximates to normal distribution under certain conditions when p is closer to 0.5 

R^2 Explained 

y = X(theta) + epsilon

Var(Y) = Var(X(theta)) + Var(epsilon) # Decomposition of Variation

R^2  = Var(X(theta))  / Var(epsilon) # Numerator = Explained Variance , Denominator (Error Term epsilon) = Unexplained Variance ,

So by definition R^2 is the percentage of variance explained (or) it is a goodness of fit but does not validate the model. 
Adding more predictor means it only going to increase R^2

Collinerity : You are interested in uncorrlated predictor variable(X) if there are 5 different category you include only 4 indicator 
bcoz of the multicollinearity it all adds upto 1

Lasso (L2) makes the paramter(beta) to zero

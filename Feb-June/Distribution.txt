Distribution :

Bernoulli Distribution - parameters (p)

 There’s no midway in Bernoulli has only two possible outcomes, namely 1 (success) and 0 (failure), and a single trial.
 The probabilities of success and failure need not be equally likely, like the result of a fight between me and Undertaker.
 
 The probability mass function is given by: p^x(1-p)^1-x  where x € (0, 1).
 
 Basically expected value of any distribution is the mean of the distribution
 
 E(X) = 1*p + 0*(1-p) = p
 
 The variance of a random variable from a bernoulli distribution is:

V(X) = E(X²) – [E(X)]² = p – p² = p(1-p)

There are many examples of Bernoulli distribution such as whether it’s going to rain tomorrow or
not where rain denotes success and no rain denotes failure and Winning (success) or losing (failure) the game


Uniform Distribution : parameters (a,b)
The probabilities of getting these outcomes are equally likely and that is the basis of a uniform distribution. 
Unlike Bernoulli Distribution, all the n number of possible outcomes of a uniform distribution are equally likely. (Rolling a fair Die)


Binomial Distribution : - Parameter (n,p)

A Bernoulli distribution repeated n times becomes binomial distribution. 

The outcomes need not be equally likely. Remember the example of a fight between me and Undertaker? 

On the basis of the above explanation, the properties of a Binomial Distribution are

Each trial is independent.
There are only two possible outcomes in a trial- either a success or a failure.
A total number of n identical trials are conducted.
The probability of success and failure is same for all trials. (Trials are identical.)
